** Notice: Version 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 and 1.0.9 - 1.1.1 were never released
           to the public.


Version 1.1.6 - 28NOV2002asg
- --------------------------

  * Changed GPL to current version.

  * Changed getc_fd to handle servers that close the data connection.

  * Changed proxy response on PASV because mozilla does not like it.

  * Added daemon mode. Now you can start ftp.proxy as daemon using '-D'.
    This is still experimental do not use this on productive environments.
    The feature will be added official in the next release.
    Additional parameters are required.

  * Applied patch which fixes problems with multi-line server greetings,
    as it appears on 'AppleShare IP FTP Server'. Mentioned by Menno Smits. 

  * Changed default log facility to LOG_DAEMON. On Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD
    it is still LOG_FTP. 

  * Modified cfputs() to send the line together with the CR/LF in one
    packet to make broken firewalls happy.


Version 1.1.5 - 04FEB2002asg
- --------------------------

  * Changed 'dologin()' so that ftp.proxy now supports server that do not
    want a password after the 'USER' command.

  * Added support for the FEAT command.
    ftp.proxy only report features to the client that are support by both
    the remote ftpserver and the ftp.proxy.

  * Disabled the modification in  request handling made in 1.1.4 for
    non-linux systems.  

  * Added `-y' to allow any data ports on any remote interfaces.  Use this
    option the following case:

	The proxy connects to an FTP server which runs on a network card
	with multiple IP numbers, a data connection is initiated (either
	PORT or PASV) and the proxy refuses the connect because the remote
	port is not on the interface the proxy uses for the data connection.
	This happens if e.g. the remote server runs on eth0:2 but the
	server uses eth0 for it's data connection port.  This is clearly
	the server's fault, but anyway.  ftp.redhat.com was reported to
	work that way.
    Try to avoid using this option, because it can cause security problems.

  * Changed log facility to LOG_FTP. (Hope this will work on all systems.) 

  * ftp.proxy now allows blanks and other special charackters in passwords.
    Added new parameter to allow this. (ftp.proxy -B)


Version 1.1.4 - 21JAN2002asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed potential problems after immediate initial unseccsesful up/downloads.

  * Fixed error in `cmdtab[]'.  ftp.proxy expected parameter for PASV. 

  * Small modification in request handling to prevent us from the rare case
    that the ftp.proxy transfers data to/from the client before the client
    has seen the "150 ..." message.


Version 1.1.3 - 06DEC2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed missing entry in syslog output. Mentioned by Markus Meitner. 
  
  * Changed array name MAXBSIZE to FTPMAXBSIZE to solve conflict when
    compiling under NetBSD or SUN Solaris.  Mentioned by Denis Ahrens.  
 
  * Changed path for `#include <wait.h>' to `<sys/wait.h>' in all sources
    to improve compatibility to NetBSD or SUN Solaris. 
    Mentioned by Denis Ahrens.  

  * Added support for the XCUP command.


Version 1.1.2 - 13NOV2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Added old X-Commands which are reintroduced by Microsoft W2K
    FTP-Client (XCWD, XPWD, XMKD, XRMD) see RFC 1123 and RFC 775.   

  * Added support for the MDTM command to check the modification
    time of a file.

  * Added new parameter to check Version. (ftp.proxy -V)

  * Enhanced server handling:

    - Attempt to solve early write events:  In some rare cases the FTP
      server send data through the data channel before the command response
      was received by the proxy.  ftp.proxy can detect such events but not
      really handle it due to the way it works.  An artifical sleep(2)
      might work as a work around.

    - There is at least one type of firewall around that didn't like
      FTP commands split into two TCP packets.  They disconnected from
      the proxy without any notice.  This problem has been fixed now.

    - ftp.proxy handles now multiline responses after a data transfer.

  * Eliminated compiler warning.



Version 1.0.7 - 11MAY2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Several manpage updates.


Version 1.0.6 - 20DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added support for the SIZE command.


Version 1.0.5 - 17DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Introduced PASV mode.

  * Several minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.4 - 27JUN2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed bug in readline_fd()/getc_fd(): Some FTP servers send two
    response lines in a single TCP/IP packet.  The second line was
    not recognized by ftp.proxy before.

  * Added -b switch to allow blanks in filenames (still not allowed
    at the beginning or end) on customer request.


Version 1.0.3 - 18MAY2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added -p option to specify the data source port ftp.proxy uses
    to connect to the client.  It's possible to tell ftp.proxy to
    use the FTP standard data port 20 but this requires root perms
    for the proxy.  Mentioned by Juergen Ilse via Wolfgang Zekoll.


Version 1.0.2 - 23SEP1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Look into sample-ccp for a command control and applied monitoring
    example.

  * Added `-b' option to allow blanks in FTP command parameters.

  * Added the monitor mode.  This is experimental.

  * Fixed a bug in the command lookup: an unknown command resulted in
    a sigsegv.

  * The ccp's output goes now to syslog while and it's stderr is sent to
    the client.

  * Fixed a file descriptor bug inside the acp and ccp handling code.


Version 1.0.1 - 27AUG1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Changed FTP session timeout to 15 minutes.

  * Added support for command control programs.
