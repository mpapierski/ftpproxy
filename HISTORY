** Notice: Version 1.0.2 - 1.0.6 and 1.0.9 - 1.1.1 were never released to the public.

Version 1.1.3 - 06Dec2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed missing entry in Syslog output. Mentioned by Markus Meitner. 
  
  * Changed array name MAXBSIZE to FTPMAXBSIZE to solve conflict when
    compiling under NetBSD or SUN Solaris. Mentioned by Denis Ahrens.  
 
  * Changed path for include wait.h to sys/wait.h in all sources to 
    improve compatibility to NetBSD or SUN Solaris. 
    Mentioned by Denis Ahrens.  

  * Added support for the XCUP command.


Version 1.1.2 - 13NOV2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Added Old X-Commands which are reintroduced by Microsoft W2K
    FTP-Client (XCWD, XPWD, XMKD, XRMD) see RFC 1123 and RFC 775.   

  * Added support for the MDTM command to check the modification
    time of a file.

  * Added new parameter to check Version. (ftp.proxy -V)

  * Enhanced server handling:

    - Attempt to solve early write events:  In some rare cases the FTP
      server send data through the data channel before the command response
      was received by the proxy.  ftp.proxy can detect such events but not
      really handle it due to the way it works.  An artifical sleep(2)
      might work as a work around.

    - There is at least one type of fireall around that didn't like
      FTP commands split into two TCP packets.  They disconnected from
      the proxy without any notice.  This problem has been fixed now.

    - ftp.proxy handles now multiline responses after a data transfer.

  * Eliminated compiler warning.



Version 1.0.7 - 11MAY2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Several manpage updates.


Version 1.0.6 - 20DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added support for the SIZE command.


Version 1.0.5 - 17DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Introduced PASV mode.

  * Several minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.4 - 27JUN2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed bug in readline_fd()/getc_fd(): Some FTP servers send two
    response lines in a single TCP/IP packet.  The second line was
    not recognized by ftp.proxy before.

  * Added -b switch to allow blanks in filenames (still not allowed
    at the beginning or end) on customer request.


Version 1.0.3 - 18MAY2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added -p option to specify the data source port ftp.proxy uses
    to connect to the client.  It's possible to tell ftp.proxy to
    use the FTP standard data port 20 but this requires root perms
    for the proxy.  Mentioned by Juergen Ilse via Wolfgang Zekoll.


Version 1.0.2 - 23SEP1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Look into sample-ccp for a command control and applied monitoring
    example.

  * Added `-b' option to allow blanks in FTP command parameters.

  * Added the monitor mode.  This is experimental.

  * Fixed a bug in the command lookup: an unknown command resulted in
    a sigsegv.

  * The ccp's output goes now to syslog while and it's stderr is sent to
    the client.

  * Fixed a file descriptor bug inside the acp and ccp handling code.


Version 1.0.1 - 27AUG1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Changed FTP session timeout to 15 minutes.

  * Added support for command control programs.
