 1. Building

	Same old story:
	
	make
	make install


 2. Installation

	After you sucessfully built and installed the daemon, you add an
	entry to your system's inentd.conf depending on your needs:

	-  clientside server selection: 

		ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/local/sbin/ftp.proxy -e

	- clientside server selection with enhanced logging: 

		ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/local/sbin/ftp.proxy -e -l -m

	- only to one particular FTP-Server:

		ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/local/sbin/ftp.proxy my.outside.server 


 3. Advanced Features

	ftp.proxy has some advanced features not found in other FTP proxies:
	advanced access control, command control and monitor mode.  They are
	explained in the manpage.

Good luck !
