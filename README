** Notice: Version 1.0.2 - 1.0.7 were never released to the public.


Version 1.0.7 - 11MAY2001asg
- --------------------------

  * Several manpage updates.


Version 1.0.6 - 20DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added support for the SIZE command.


Version 1.0.5 - 17DEC2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Introduced PASV mode.

  * Several minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.4 - 27JUN2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Fixed bug in readline_fd()/getc_fd(): Some FTP servers send two
    response lines in a single TCP/IP packet.  The second line was
    not recognized by ftp.proxy before.

  * Added -b switch to allow blanks in filenames (still not allowed
    at the beginning or end) on customer request.


Version 1.0.3 - 18MAY2000asg
- --------------------------

  * Added -p option to specify the data source port ftp.proxy uses
    to connect to the client.  It's possible to tell ftp.proxy to
    use the FTP standard data port 20 but this requires root perms
    for the proxy.  Mentioned by Juergen Ilse via Wolfgang Zekoll.


Version 1.0.2 - 23SEP1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Look into sample-ccp for a command control and applied monitoring
    example.

  * Added `-b' option to allow blanks in FTP command parameters.

  * Added the monitor mode.  This is experimental.

  * Fixed a bug in the command lookup: an unknown command resulted in
    a sigsegv.

  * The ccp's output goes now to syslog while and it's stderr is sent to
    the client.

  * Fixed a file descriptor bug inside the acp and ccp handling code.


Version 1.0.1 - 27AUG1999wzk
- --------------------------

  * Changed FTP session timeout to 15 minutes.

  * Added support for command control programs.
